#🏥 Medical-Data-Extraction-System (Ongoing)

📌 Overview

The Medical Data Extraction System is an AI-powered solution designed to automatically extract structured information from unstructured medical documents such as prescriptions, reports, and patient records.

It integrates OCR, NLP, and ML/DL techniques to identify and classify key entities (e.g., patient details, medicines, diagnoses) for use in healthcare analytics, patient management, and digital record-keeping.

---

🎯 Objectives

Convert scanned medical documents into machine-readable text.

Extract and classify key medical entities (patients, medicines, diagnoses, doctors).

Build an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and storage.

Enable searchable and analyzable healthcare data for downstream applications.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Frameworks:

OCR: OpenCV, PyTesseract

NLP: SpaCy, NLTK

ML/DL: scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL (for structured storage)

Visualization (optional): Power BI / Streamlit for reporting insights

---

🔄 Workflow

Document Input – Scanned PDFs / images are uploaded.

OCR Processing – Text extracted using Tesseract + OpenCV preprocessing.

NLP Pipeline – Cleaning, tokenization, entity recognition (NER).

ML/DL Models – Classifying medical terms into categories (Patient, Medicine, Diagnosis, Doctor).

Storage – Extracted structured data stored in a database.

(Optional) Visualization – Reports generated for analytics.
